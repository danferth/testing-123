    "description" : "Thomson Filter Vials (patented) are designed to speed up sample prep and analysis. The plunger filter with different membranes nestles into the vial while simultaneously filtering and readying the sample for any Autosampler. This is a process that minimizes any loss of sample eliminating multiple transfers. Pre-slit caps ensure a no-hassle, clean aliquot withdraw. Eliminating breakage of expensive needles, coring problems on the HPLC or Mass Spec. Thomson Filter Vials are compatible with most standard Autosamplers; such as Agilent® and Waters® including the UHPLC™. The ease of use will make the Filter Vial indispensable in all laboratories."

      "description" : "Thomson eXtractor3D|FV® (patented) offers filtration withincreased volume enabling multiple extraction techniques with different resins/sorbents or solids/large particulates (greater than 35%) to autosampler ready vials. eXtractor3D|FV® is a product uniquely designed for the addition of resins/sorbents, QuEChERS dispersive salts, pills, or special resins in the standard autosampler ready vial. The filter vial consists of two parts: a filter vial shell and a plunger which includes a multi-layer filter on one end and a screw cap on the other end. Large solids/large particulates can be placed within the eXtractor3D|FV® where multiple extraction techniques occur. Prior to the introduction of the eXtractor3D|FV®, samples required multiple steps using SPE, or other methods to remove interfering analytes and co-eluting compounds. SPE or Quechers can now be completed with multi-depth filtration without risk of solids compromising the autosampler. Pills and other large solids can be broken down for complete testing using the eXtractor3D|FV®. eXtractor3D|FV® allows for compounds to be separated from the matrix with the addition of resins/sorbents, resulting in both a higher signal to noise ratio and peaks that are more differentiated."

      "description" : "The MEGA|FV™ (patented) with 15mL working volume, from Thomson Instrument Company, performs similarly to our other Filter Vials. Available in multiple membranes (PVDF, PTFE & Nylon) and pore sizes (0.45µm & 0.2µm), the MEGA|FV™ can be used for many applications from biologics to chemistry to food science. The MEGA|FV™ is a valuable tool for fast filtration of large sample volumes in your daily applications. It allows for filtration of up to 15mL in one vial, letting you move quickly from sample clean-up to analysis or storage, and providing clean, filtered samples ready for multiple applications. The Multi-Use Press (p/n # 35015) can accommodate up to 8 MEGA|FV™s at a time. The Multi-Use Press 8-Position Rack fits most standard robots for automated sample applications."
